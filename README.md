# DevMatch
DevMatch is a website that aims to make the process of forming and operating in teams
seamless. Our platform matches users with the right people for their projects and provides
tools to help manage them after a team has been formed. 

We provide an all-in-one project-building service that not only helps with finding team members but also includes
document editing, messaging, calling, and task management features. This simplifies the
project creation and organization process by eliminating the need to connect on several
different platforms to achieve different tasks.
